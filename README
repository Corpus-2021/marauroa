Marauroa
--------
Marauroa is Arianne's Multiplayer Online Engine Server, that you can use to build
you own online games using Marauroa as a Content Management system.


Extended Description
--------------------
Marauroa is completly written in Java using a multithreaded server architecture
with a TCP oriented network protocol, a mySQL based persistence engine and a
flexible game system based on open systems totally expandible and modifiable
by developers and that is able to run scripts on Python for the game's rules.

Marauroa is based on a philosophy we call Action/Perception, on each turn a
perception is sent to clients explaining them what they percieve and clients
can ask server to do any action in their names using actions.
Marauroa is totally game agnostic and makes very little assumptions about what
are you trying to do, allowing a great freedom to create whatever type of game
you want.

You can find the latest version of Marauroa at:
http://arianne.sourceforge.net

Marauroa is a GPL project.


Current Version
---------------
Version 2.0.2


Requeriments
------------
To actually compile Marauroa you will need:
- Java SDK 1.5 http://java.sun.com
- Ant 1.6 http://ant.apache.org

In order to get it working with MySQL you will also need:
- MySQL Connector/J http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html

  NOTE: Unfortunatelly, Marauroa uses some SQL features that make its code
  slightly incompatible with other DBMS. Join us and help to port SQL code
  to a real standard complaint DBMS.

- JUnit 4.0 in order to run test cases.
- Jython for Python support.


Build
-----
Make sure ant ( http://ant.apache.org/ ) is installed.
Now just write:

  ant jar

Or for a complete package release write:

  ant


Status
------
Version >= 2.0.2 does support Stendhal >= 0.63
Version >= 2.0 doesn't support anything yet. YOU ARE WARNED!.
Version >= 0.90 && < 1.90 support Stendhal: a multiplayer Zelda like game using Java and Java2D
Version >= 0.90 support JMapacman: a multiplayer pacman game using Java and Java2D
Version >= 0.33 && < 0.90 support mapacman: a multiplayer pacman game using the Python rules.
Version >= 0.20 && < 0.33 support a simple Gladiators game using the Marauroa engine.

You need to grab game package in order to be able to play it.


Running
-------
Ok, you have compiled Marauroa. Now what to do?

Well, if you have built a Marauroa server it is because you
want to play with the server either because you want to run your own
game server or because you are a developer wanting to develop your own game.
If you don't understand the above it is prone that you are looking for
http://arianne.sourceforge.net instead.
